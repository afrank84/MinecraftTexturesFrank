The folder structure for Minecraft texture packs (also called resource packs) follows a specific layout to ensure proper functionality within the game. Here’s an overview of the standard structure:

1. **`pack.mcmeta`**  
   - A JSON file that defines metadata about the resource pack, including its description and the Minecraft version it supports.
   - Example content:
     ```json
     {
       "pack": {
         "pack_format": 12, 
         "description": "Your Texture Pack Description"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **`pack.png`**  
   - An optional image file representing the resource pack icon (typically 128x128 pixels).

3. **`assets`**  
   - This folder contains all game assets (textures, sounds, models, etc.). The directory should follow the structure based on Minecraft’s internal asset system.
   
   **Inside `assets` folder:**
   
   - **`minecraft`** (The main Minecraft assets folder, containing all custom resources.)
     - **`blockstates`**: Defines the behavior and textures of blocks (JSON files).
     - **`font`**: Font files for in-game text.
     - **`lang`**: Custom language files.
     - **`models`**: 3D model files for blocks and items (JSON format).
       - **`block`**: 3D models for blocks.
       - **`item`**: 3D models for items.
     - **`textures`**: This is where most of the actual textures for the game go.
       - **`block`**: Block textures (e.g., stone, dirt).
       - **`entity`**: Mob and entity textures (e.g., cows, zombies).
       - **`gui`**: Textures for the GUI (e.g., inventory screens).
       - **`item`**: Item textures (e.g., swords, apples).
       - **`effect`**: Textures for potion effects or other game effects.
       - **`environment`**: Sky, cloud, rain, etc., textures.
     - **`sounds`**: Custom sounds used in the game.
     - **`shaders`**: Custom shaders (if applicable).

### Example folder structure:
```
- my_texture_pack/
  - assets/
    - minecraft/
      - blockstates/
      - models/
        - block/
        - item/
      - textures/
        - block/
        - entity/
        - gui/
        - item/
        - environment/
      - sounds/
  - pack.mcmeta
  - pack.png
```

Make sure each texture file is in the `.png` format and placed in the correct subfolder under `textures`. This structure helps Minecraft locate and apply your custom textures during gameplay.
